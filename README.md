# Car-price-predictor
Car Price Predictor is a machine learning model that estimates a car's price based on factors like brand, year, kilometers driven, and fuel type. It helps users make informed decisions by predicting fair market prices accurately.

Overview

Our model did not perform well because the dataset was small, containing only 581 rows and 24 columns. This limited the model’s ability to learn complex patterns. However, the process of analyzing and predicting car prices remains the same, and with a larger dataset, the model's performance can significantly improve.

Key Insights from Analysis

Through extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), we identified several factors that significantly impact car prices:

Year of Manufacture & Price Relationship:

There is a linear relationship between the car's manufacturing year and its price.

Newer cars tend to have a higher resale price, while older cars depreciate over time, leading to lower prices.

Fuel Type Impact on Price:

Diesel cars generally have higher prices compared to petrol cars.

Petrol cars are more common and affordable, making them a popular choice among buyers.

Whenever the fuel type is diesel, there is a higher chance of an increased price.

Importance of Data Size:

The dataset used for training had only 581 rows and 24 columns, which limited the model’s ability to learn complex patterns.

Due to this small dataset size, the model's performance was not optimal.

With a larger dataset, the model could improve significantly and provide more accurate price predictions.

Conclusion

Our analysis provided deep insights into car pricing factors. However, due to data limitations, the model’s accuracy was restricted. Increasing the dataset size and incorporating more diverse data points can enhance the model’s performance and prediction reliability.
