Car Price Predictor is a machine learning model that estimates a car's price based on factors like brand, year, kilometers driven, and fuel type. It helps users make informed decisions by predicting fair market prices accurately.

Overview

Our model did not perform well because the dataset was small, containing only 581 rows and 24 columns. This limited the model’s ability to learn complex patterns. However, the process of analyzing and predicting car prices remains the same, and with a larger dataset, the model's performance can significantly improve.

Key Insights from Analysis

The manufacturing year of a car plays a crucial role in determining its price. There is a clear linear relationship where newer cars tend to have higher resale values, whereas older cars depreciate significantly over time. Buyers often prefer recent models, which further drives up the price of newer vehicles.

The fuel type also has a significant impact on pricing. Diesel cars generally command higher prices due to their fuel efficiency and long-term cost savings. On the other hand, petrol cars are more common and generally more affordable, making them a popular choice for budget-conscious buyers. The data suggests that whenever a car has a diesel engine, there is a higher likelihood of an increased price.

The size of the dataset greatly influences the model’s performance. The dataset used for training had only 581 rows and 24 columns, which restricted the model’s ability to capture complex pricing patterns. Due to the limited data, the model struggled to generalize well, affecting its prediction accuracy. With a larger and more diverse dataset, the model would be able to learn better relationships and improve its predictive power.

Conclusion

Our analysis provided deep insights into the factors influencing car prices. However, due to data limitations, the model’s accuracy was restricted. Increasing the dataset size and incorporating more diverse data points can enhance the model’s performance and prediction reliability.
